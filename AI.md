# AI-Assisted Development Report

**Tool Used:** Gemini (Google AI)

## 1. Javadoc Documentation

### How it helped
I used the AI to generate standardized Javadoc comments for the major classes in the `milo.task`, `milo.parser`, and `milo.command` packages.

### Details
The AI ensured that all `@param`, `@return`, and `@throws` tags were technically accurate and adhered to the project’s formatting requirements. This improved the overall readability and maintainability of the codebase.
